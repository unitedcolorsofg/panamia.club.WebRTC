              <p>
                In the spring of 2022, Anette and Clari, two emerging
                entrepreneurs, formed a fated bond at a Miami market. Despite
                their differences, their friendship deepened over time, evolving
                into an opportunity for something greater than themselves.
              </p>
              <p>
                Their shared dreams and mutual support became the catalyst for
                the creation of Pana MIA Club, proving that entrepreneurship
                doesn't have to be a solo journey. Together, they discovered the
                power of unity among local entrepreneurs and creatives. Pana
                MIA's story began in that unexpected meeting that transformed
                into the foundation of it all.

                <p>
                  Anette Mago, a Venezuelan-American conceptual artist raised in
                  South Florida, has long been fascinated by the multicultural
                  landscape and vibrant community of her home state. Having
                  graduated from the University of Florida in Visual Art Studies
                  in 2021, she delved into the Miami art scene while
                  establishing her artwear brand, Alobebi. Two years into her
                  entrepreneurial journey, Anette formed a close bond with
                  Claribel, another small business owner. Recognizing the
                  importance of a supportive community, Anette's realization led
                  to the creation of Pana MIA Club, her most ambitious art
                  project to date.

                <p>
                  Claribel Avila is a Puerto Rican entrepreneur and creative who
                  began calling Miami home in 2021. They graduated from
                  Northeastern University in 2018 with a Bachelors in Economic
                  Policy. Having been raised by an entrepreneurial migrant
                  family, they explored diverse industries and started their
                  first business in 2019, selling herbal-infused honey. Despite
                  their many passions and personal pursuits, their central focus
                  has always been social, economic and racial justice. Moving to
                  Miami brought purpose, and as a problem solver, their work
                  with Pana MIA Club soon became a way to leverage strengths in
                  order to bring about a more equitable and humane world.
