          </a>
          <p>Pana MIA Club is a 501(c)(3) non-profit based in South Florida.</p>
          <p>
            We are an inclusive South Florida Locals' Directory representing
            entrepreneurs, creatives and organizations of all backgrounds. Our
            mission is to empower the local community by providing essential
            tools to unite resources, insights, reach, and strategies,
            cultivating a thriving environment for all.
          </p>
          <p>
            As consumers start recognizing the benefits of shopping locally, our
            centralized directory is a place where the public can explore and
            fall in love with local brands. Created by two small business
            owners, Pana MIA Club is designed by and for SoFlo creatives &
            entrepreneurs to come together.
          </p>
          <p>We live up to our motto in every part of our platform.</p>
          <p>
            <strong>Yo tu Pana, tú la MIA</strong>
          </p>
          <p>I, your friend and you mine.</p>

          <blockquote>
            Pana MIA Club is an all-inclusive platform for all things
            locally-based in South Florida. We are dedicated to closing the gap
            between Patron and Pana, making it easier than ever to support
            local. We cross-promote small businesses and creatives using our
            Locals Directory; a one-stop shop for anything you need (art, food,
            services, apparel, platforms etc) provided locally, *finally* a
            centralized space where you can explore and fall in love with local
            brands all over South Florida.

          <p>
            Clari and Anette met at a Good Vibes Market at the Center for
            Subtropical Affairs. Anette is an art wear brand owner and art
            teacher based out of Miramar. Clari is a certified yoga teacher and
            owns a small honey brand company. Despite the different
            industries—and the fact that Anette doesn’t like honey, the two
            started supporting one another. Pana MIA Club is the direct result
            from realizing we do not have to do everything alone. Local
            entrepreneurs and creatives are stronger when they collaborate and
            contribute to our collective knowledge and experiences.

          <p>
            So now that you know who we are, what is it we’re trying to do? We
            have many projects in the works but our first goal is to create our
            online keyword-searchable Local’s Directory. With over 300 members
            in our collective, Anette and I are excited to have a website up so
            local patrons can search through and find their new favorite brands.

          <p>
            The most effective way of converting consumers into local shoppers
            is by creating systems they are familiar with. Our online
            keyword-search Local’s Directory makes it natural for a local patron
            to enter a keyword search (i.e. “Gluten-free Bakery) and find
            locally sourced solutions to meet any need/desire. The patron can
            browse and select any profile they see in search results which will
            link to a personalized profile of our Pana. These profiles includes
            an image gallery, descriptive content, contact links and more.
          </p>
