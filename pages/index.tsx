                We are organizing the South Florida diversified working class to
                build regenerative and vibrant economies. By connecting locals
                with quality resources and educating on the benefits of
                reinvesting locally, we cultivate financial security, personal
                engagement, and emphasize the power of a unified community.

          <p>
            Miami is filled with small vendors, all with different strengths and
            skillsets. We started Pana Mia as a way to bring everyone together,
            to pool our resources, insights and strategies. As consumers start
            recognizing the benefits of shopping local, we want to create a
            centralized space where they can explore and fall in love with local
            brands.
