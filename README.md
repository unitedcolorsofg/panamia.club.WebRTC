## About

Pana Mia Club is a 501(c)(3) non-profit built to support the creation of regenerative and vibrant economies in South Florida.
"The Future is Local" - we connect artists, creatives, and local businesses. This is our core software tool.

This project is:

- **Source Reviewable**: Publicly available to encourage collaboration on local projects
- **Community-Focused**: Built for connecting South Florida artists, venues, and music lovers
- **Accessible**: Following WCAG guidelines and best practices
- **Budget-Conscious**: Using cost-effective, scalable technologies

### Key Features

- **User Profiles & Directory**: Browse and connect with community members
- **Mentoring Platform**: Peer-to-peer video mentoring (prototype)
- **Event Listings**: Integration with Shotgun Live for venue events
- **Authentication**: Secure, passwordless login with NextAuth v5
- **Responsive Design**: Mobile-first, accessible UI with Tailwind CSS

---

## Quick Start

Get up and running in 5 minutes:

```bash
# 1. Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/panamiaclub/panamia.club.git
cd panamia.club

# 2. Install dependencies
npm install

# 3. Set up environment variables
cp example.env .env.local
# Edit .env.local with your credentials

# 4. Start development server
npm run dev

# 5. Open https://localhost:3000
```

**Need help with environment variables?** [Contact us](https://www.panamia.club/form/contact-us/) for a developer ENV file.

---

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have:

- **Node.js**: Version 20.x or higher ([Download](https://nodejs.org/))
- **npm**: Version 10.x or higher (comes with Node.js)
- **MongoDB Atlas Account**: Required for search functionality ([Sign up](https://www.mongodb.com/cloud/atlas))
- **Git**: For version control

**MongoDB Atlas is REQUIRED for full functionality.** The directory and admin search features use Atlas Search indexes (`$search` aggregation), which are not available in local MongoDB instances. Without Atlas, search functionality will not work.

### Optional Services

These are required for full functionality:

- **Pusher Account**: For real-time features (free tier available)
- **Stripe Account**: For payment processing (test mode available)
- **BunnyCDN Account**: For file uploads (optional for local development)
- **Email Service**: For authentication emails (NodeMailer with SMTP or Brevo)

---

## Installation

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/panamiaclub/panamia.club.git
cd panamia.club
```

### 2. Install Dependencies

```bash
npm install
```

This will install all required packages including:

- Next.js, React, TypeScript
- NextAuth for authentication
- MongoDB/Mongoose for database
- Tailwind CSS for styling
- Playwright for testing

### 3. Set Up Environment Variables

Copy the example file and configure:

```bash
cp example.env .env.local
```

Edit `.env.local` with your actual credentials. See `example.env` for all available options and detailed comments.

**Key configurations:**

- **MONGODB_URI**: Must be MongoDB Atlas connection string (required for search)
- **NEXTAUTH_SECRET**: Generate with `openssl rand -base64 32`
- **NEXTAUTH_URL**: Set to `https://localhost:3000` for development
- **PUSHER\_\***: Required for mentoring video features
- **EMAIL*SERVER*\***: Required for authentication

### 4. Set Up MongoDB Atlas

1. Create free account at [MongoDB Atlas](https://www.mongodb.com/cloud/atlas)
2. Create a cluster
3. Configure Atlas Search indexes for the `profiles` collection
4. Get connection string and add to `.env.local` as `MONGODB_URI`
5. Add your IP address to Atlas IP whitelist

---

## Development

### Start Development Server

```bash
npm run dev
```

The application will be available at **https://localhost:3000**

The dev server includes:

- Hot module replacement (HMR)
- Fast refresh for React components
- Automatic TypeScript compilation
- Error overlay with detailed stack traces

### Code Quality

**Run linter:**

```bash
npm run lint
```

**Auto-fix linting issues:**

```bash
npm run lint -- --fix
```

**Format code with Prettier:**

```bash
npx prettier --write .
```

### Git Hooks (Husky)

Pre-commit hooks automatically run on every commit:

- Prettier formatting
- ESLint checks
- TypeScript compilation check

These ensure code quality before commits are created.

---

## Testing

### End-to-End Tests (Playwright)

Playwright tests are automatically run on every `git push` via GitHub Actions CI/CD pipeline. You can also run them locally:

```bash
# Run all tests
npm test

# Run tests in UI mode (interactive)
npm run test:ui

# Run tests in headed mode (see browser)
npm run test:headed

# View test report
npm run test:report
```

**Important**: Tests will run automatically when you push to GitHub. Check the Actions tab for results.

### Test Coverage

Current test coverage includes:

- Authentication flows
- Profile creation and editing
- Directory search
- Navigation and routing

See `docs/TESTING_CHECKLIST.md` for manual testing procedures.

---

## Deployment

### Vercel Deployment (Recommended)

**Automatic deployment:**

1. Push to `main` branch
2. Vercel automatically builds and deploys
3. Preview deployments for all branches

**Environment variables:**

Set these in Vercel dashboard (Settings → Environment Variables):

- All variables from `.env.local`
- Set `NODE_ENV=production`
- Ensure `NEXTAUTH_URL` points to production domain (HTTPS)

**Deployment requirements:**

- HTTPS is automatically enforced in production via middleware
- All security headers are set automatically
- MongoDB Atlas connection must be from allowed IPs (configure Atlas IP whitelist)

### Build Locally

```bash
# Create production build
npm run build

# Start production server
npm start
```

### Branch Deployments

Every branch pushed to GitHub gets a preview deployment:

- View status in GitHub PR checks
- Access preview URL from PR comments
- Test features before merging
